    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Today I’m so excited to show you how to make the best Cheesecake Recipe of
      your life. Simple, classic, and no water bath required!! The texture is
      smooth, rich, and creamy, served over a crisp homemade graham cracker
      crust.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Brick cream cheese</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Sour cream</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to
        350°F (177°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the crust: If you’re starting out with full graham crackers, use a
        food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a
        medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the
        melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash/break up any large
        chunks. Pour into an ungreased 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. With
        medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and
        partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy
        force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the
        mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly and you can use the flat bottom of a
        small measuring cup to help smooth it all out if needed. Pre-bake for 10
        minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of
        aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in
        step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle
        attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on
        medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and
        creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon
        juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one
        at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the
        final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent
        the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid
        over-mixing the batter as best you can. You will have close to 6 cups of
        batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the simple water bath (see note): If needed for extra visuals,
        see my How to Make a Cheesecake Water Bath; the visual guide will assist
        you in this step. Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your
        roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an
        entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the
        aluminum foil around the springform pan. Place the pan inside of a large
        roasting pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a
        rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Carefully pour
        the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place
        the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in.
        Whichever is easier for you.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake cheesecake for 55–70 minutes or until the center is almost set. If
        you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it with
        aluminum foil halfway through baking. When it’s done, the center of the
        cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the
        oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the
        oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven
        and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely uncovered at room
        temperature. Then cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4
        hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
        springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into
        slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into
        warm water between each slice.
