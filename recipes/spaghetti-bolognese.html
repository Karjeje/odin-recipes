    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      And here she is – my Spag Bol. Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the
      sauce even if you only have time for a quick 20 minute simmer. Though if
      you can slow cook for a couple of hours, it really takes it to another
      level!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Spaghetti</li>
      <li>Carrot</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sauté – Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat.
        Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and
        softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook beef – Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as
        your go, until browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer – Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then
        turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no
        lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and add more salt it desired. Serve over spaghetti – though if you
        have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.
